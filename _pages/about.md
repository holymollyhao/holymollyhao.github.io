I’m Taewon Kim, a Ph.D. candidate at KAIST AI advised by
[Prof. Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home). My
research sits at the intersection of AI and the natural sciences, where I aim
to build foundation models that turn complex biological data into usable
scientific insight. Technically, my recent focuses are 3D protein representation
learning and genomic large language models.
